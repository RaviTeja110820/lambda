# EC2 Start Stop

The goal of this project is to automate the start and stop operations of Amazon EC2 instances at regular intervals using AWS lambda and CloudWatch Events. This automation helps optimize costs by ensuring that EC2 instances are only running when needed, such as during business hours.
