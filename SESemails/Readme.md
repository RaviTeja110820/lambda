# send mass emails using AWS Lambda

## steps:

1. Set up an email delivery service: You can use Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) to send emails. Ensure that you have an SES account and your domain is verified.

2. Create an AWS Lambda function: Go to the AWS Management Console and open the Lambda service. Click on "Create function" and provide a name, runtime (e.g., Python), and execution role.

3. Configure the Lambda function: In the function configuration, you can set up environment variables, triggers, and other settings. Ensure that you grant the necessary permissions for the Lambda function to access SES.

4. Write the Lambda function code: Use the runtime language of your choice (e.g., Python)

5. Test the Lambda function: Use the Lambda test functionality or create a test event to simulate the execution of your function and ensure that it sends the emails correctly.

6. Trigger the Lambda function: You can trigger the Lambda function in various ways, depending on your requirements. For example, you can set up a CloudWatch Event to trigger the function periodically or invoke it manually.

>> Please note that sending mass emails must comply with the terms of service of your email service provider and applicable laws and regulations regarding unsolicited emails (spam). Be sure to follow best practices and obtain proper consent and authorization before sending mass emails.
